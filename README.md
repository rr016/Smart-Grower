# Smart Grower - Operating Systems Project ![](https://github.com/rr016/Smart-Grower/blob/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/icon_smartgrower.png)
Android app that connects to Arduino through BlueTooth. Schedules when and how long your grow light stays on.

### Project Background
"For those trying to make healthier dietary choices, getting fresh produce from the market can really start to add up on your wallet. Luckily, the seeds for many vegetables can be bought for a low cost. The only problem is the hassle of germinating the seeds, and for those who crave a vegetable that’s out of season, growing them to fruition inside the home.

That’s why we decided to create the Indoor Smart Garden Grower. Using our grow box that’s accompanied by an easy to use app, the user will have a safe growing environment for their vegetables, as the ability to easily schedule the amount of light they’d like their vegetables to get each day from their phone. 

No need to keep track of the time; no need to turn a grow lamp on and off manually; and no need to worry about the safety of your vegetables. Simply place your seeded container inside the grow box, set your desired light schedule, and return to your healthily germinated vegetable seeds.

For those who plan to use the Indoor Smart Garden Grower to grow vegetables to fruition, the app also includes a scheduled watering reminder so the user never forgets to water their vegetables."
